# Express & Node based Local documentation viewer

## Motivation
I prefer dark mode and spend at least six hours per day in reading. but when open local pdf file in chrome, its whole extension is prevented to working.

So i thought that make a web app runs in local pc, and inhibit external access to it, it should work properly with chrome extension.
