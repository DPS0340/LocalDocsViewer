# Express & Node based Local documentation viewer

## Motivation
I prefer dark mode and spend 6h~/day in reading.

but when i open local pdf file in chrome, its whole extension(includes dark mode) is prevented from working.

it causes imbalance of illumination.

So i thought that make a web app runs in local pc, and inhibit external access to it, it should work properly with chrome extension.
